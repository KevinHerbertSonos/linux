	This directory holds Sonos Bridge code that is common to all Linux
kernel versions. Previously, this code existed in the
platforms/linux/linux-<version>/net/bridge/ directories, which resulted in
duplicate code between kernel versions. This also meant that for each new
kernel, all of this Sonos-specific code had to be forward-ported by hand, which
was a tedious task. This directory has been added as part of a bridge
refactoring effort that seeks to extract as much Sonos code from the Bridge as
possible, and store it in a common location.
	This directory currently applies to the Linux-3.10 kernel, and will be
expanded over time to be used by other kernel versions.
	At compile time, each Sonos build will create symlinks into this
directory, rather than including the directory within makefiles. This is done
in platforms/linux/Makefile.
